For tropical drought, DNA extractions were performed using the Qiagen RNeasy power water kit, which
extracts total RNA and DNA. This method utilizes the same principle used in temperate grasses in that
vortexing whole leaves with beads and lysis buffer increases bacterial DNA extractions while minimizing
